Leveraging gradient information and iterative optimization, the proposed approach refines the parameters of COBRA’s dynamical model such as coefficient of friction and actuator parameters using experimental and simulated data.

Although computer simulations provide a safe and efficient training environment, the resulting policies often fail to transfer effectively to real hardware due to the “Simulation-to-Reality Gap” (sim2real gap), caused by discrepancies such as differences in friction, joint dynamics, and sensor noise between simulated and real environments. These discrepancies impede the transition of control policies from simulation to real-world applications, resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization of robotic systems.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sim2real_methods_new-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sim2real_methods_new-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sim2real_methods_new-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/sim2real_methods_new.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 1: Popular Solutions for Solving Sim2real Problem </div> <p>To tackle the challenges of the Simulation-to-Reality Gap, recent research has focused on several advanced strategies.

CPGs are crucial for locomotion and other rhythmic behaviors, producing rhythmic patterns even without sensory feedback or external stimuli. This autonomous rhythmicity allows for automatic and adaptive rhythmic movements without constant conscious control.</p> <p>In research and robotics, CPGs are studied for their potential in biomimetic control of locomotion and other behaviors in artificial systems.

Motion capture technology recorded the trajectories of the head, tail, and middle links, along with joint trajectory data for all eleven joints. Odd-numbered joints executed pitching motions, while even-numbered joints executed yawing motions. A sidewinding gait was generated using a sinusoidal input signal to each joint, with adjustable parameters to modify the robot’s behavior. The input signal followed a sine-wave pattern with varying phase differences applied to each joint:</p> \[A_{pitching} = 14^\circ, A_{yawing} = 60^\circ\] \[\phi = \frac{\pi}{2} [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1]\] <p>The identical trajectory was also executed in the Webots simulator, allowing observation of the discrepancy between the simulator and the actual robot. This disparity is more evident in Figure 7, which compares the head trajectories over time for three different gait patterns in both the actual robot and the base simulator (untuned model). Gait 1 represents sidewinding at 0.35 Hz, Gait 2 at 0.5 Hz, and Gait 3 at 0.65 Hz. Additionally, Figure 8 highlights how the performance of the actuator model also contributes to the gap between simulation and reality. These disparities hinder the seamless transfer of control policies from simulation to the real robot, limiting the effectiveness of learned behaviors in practical applications. Addressing the sim-to-real issue is crucial for ensuring COBRA’s reliability and robustness in diverse and dynamic environments.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sim2real_head_trajectories-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sim2real_head_trajectories-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sim2real_head_trajectories-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/sim2real_head_trajectories.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 7: Illustrates sim-to-real gap observed in COBRA’s head link trajectory while performing sidewinding gaits at frequencies of 0.35 Hz, 0.5 Hz, and 0.65 Hz respectively </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sim2real_joint_angles-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sim2real_joint_angles-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sim2real_joint_angles-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/sim2real_joint_angles.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 8: Illustrates sim-to-real gap observed in COBRA’s joint angles while performing sidewinding gaits at frequencies of 0.35 Hz, 0.5 Hz, and 0.65 Hz respectively </div> <hr/> <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2> <p>The proposed model matching framework (Fig. 9) is designed to tune the dynamic model and identify accurate parameters that minimize the disparity between simulation and reality using a reinforcement learning-based method. Our methodology involved executing a predetermined sidewinding trajectory (operating at 0.5 Hz) on both the physical COBRA robot and the Webots simulator. A sidewinding trajectory command guided both systems through identical movements. Performance analysis was conducted in two domains: underactuated dynamics, which involved comparing the head’s position and orientation to identify contact force discrepancies, and actuated dynamics, focusing on joint angle trajectories to evaluate movement precision. Positional data for the head, middle link, tail, and joints were collected during the sidewinding gait. Alignment between simulation and reality was quantified using a reward function, and a reinforcement learning agent adjusted model parameters to maximize this function, aiming to minimize the sim2real gap.

One such strategy is Loco-manipulation, which involves manipulating objects in the robot’s vicinity during locomotion tasks. This technique is especially significant for the COBRA platform, leveraging its unique design to enhance dexterity and precision in object manipulation. By integrating locomotion and manipulation seamlessly, COBRA can increase its functionality and adaptability across various tasks, boosting overall efficiency and versatility. In the following sections, I introduce the Loco-manipulation controller, detailing its design and functionality. Although this controller addresses the specified problem effectively, it is important to note that the current version cannot be directly transferred to the real robot because the locomotion policy was trained using an untuned model.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/locoman.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Video 2: Shows COBRA performing loco-manipulation </div> <hr/> <h2 id="methodology-1">Methodology</h2> <p>The hierarchical framework for developing the loco-manipulation controller is illustrated in Fig. 10. This structure simplifies the problem by dividing it into two parts, detailed step-by-step in Algorithm 1. The high-level manipulation path planner (steps 1 and 2 in the algorithm) plans the trajectory from the robot’s head position to designated goal positions, ensuring the robot can effectively manipulate an object from its initial location to the target. This planner creates waypoints along the path and sends them to the low-level locomotion controller (steps 3 and 4 in algorithm). The low-level locomotion controller receives these waypoints and executes them using a locomotion policy trained with reinforcement learning. This policy generates parameters for the modified kuramoto CPG model, which determines the joint positions necessary for the robot’s movements.
