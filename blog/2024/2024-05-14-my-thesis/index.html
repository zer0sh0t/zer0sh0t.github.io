Although computer simulations provide a safe and efficient training environment, the resulting policies often fail to transfer effectively to real hardware due to the “Simulation-to-Reality Gap” (sim2real gap), caused by discrepancies such as differences in friction, joint dynamics, and sensor noise between simulated and real environments. These discrepancies impede the transition of control policies from simulation to real-world applications, resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization of robotic systems.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sim2real_methods_new-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sim2real_methods_new-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sim2real_methods_new-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/sim2real_methods_new.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="" height="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 1: Popular Solutions for Solving Sim2real Problem </div> <p>To tackle the challenges of the Simulation-to-Reality Gap, recent research has focused on several advanced strategies. These include employing more sophisticated system identification procedures to improve model accuracy, training policies on real robots while simultaneously enhancing simulator accuracy through domain adaptation, and developing robust control policies that can generalize across varied simulated environments through domain randomization. Although these methods have shown good transferability of learned policies from simulation to real robots, they typically require at least 1000 hours of training in the simulator and/or hundreds of rollouts on the real robot.

CPGs are crucial for locomotion and other rhythmic behaviors, producing rhythmic patterns even without sensory feedback or external stimuli. This autonomous rhythmicity allows for automatic and adaptive rhythmic movements without constant conscious control.</p> <p>In research and robotics, CPGs are studied for their potential in biomimetic control of locomotion and other behaviors in artificial systems. By modeling CPG principles in artificial neural networks, researchers can create control systems that mimic biological rhythmicity, integrating these artificial CPGs into robotic systems for autonomous and efficient control of locomotion, navigation, and other motor functions.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/joint_traj_robot-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/joint_traj_robot-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/joint_traj_robot-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/joint_traj_robot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="" height="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 5: Signals generated from a simple sine wave CPG </div> <h2 id="modified-kuramoto-model">Modified Kuramoto Model</h2> <p>The Kuramoto CPG model is a mathematical framework for describing rhythmic oscillatory behavior in biological systems, particularly for robotic locomotion control, by using coupled phase oscillators to generate synchronized and coordinated rhythmic patterns.

(Right) Joint angle data (for all joints) is also collected while the robot is executing the sidewinding trajectory </div> <p>The simulation-to-reality gap observed in the Webots simulator is highlighted in experiments conducted on the physical robot (Video 1). Motion capture technology recorded the trajectories of the head, tail, and middle links, along with joint trajectory data for all eleven joints. Odd-numbered joints executed pitching motions, while even-numbered joints executed yawing motions. A sidewinding gait was generated using a sinusoidal input signal to each joint, with adjustable parameters to modify the robot’s behavior. The input signal followed a sine-wave pattern with varying phase differences applied to each joint:</p> <p>\(A_{pitching} = 14^\circ, A_{yawing} = 60^\circ\) \(\phi = \frac{\pi}{2} [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1]\)</p> <p>The identical trajectory was also executed in the Webots simulator, allowing observation of the discrepancy between the simulator and the actual robot. This disparity is more evident in Figure 7, which compares the head trajectories over time for three different gait patterns in both the actual robot and the base simulator (untuned model). Gait 1 represents sidewinding at 0.35 Hz, Gait 2 at 0.5 Hz, and Gait 3 at 0.65 Hz. Additionally, Figure 8 highlights how the performance of the actuator model also contributes to the gap between simulation and reality. These disparities hinder the seamless transfer of control policies from simulation to the real robot, limiting the effectiveness of learned behaviors in practical applications. Addressing the sim-to-real issue is crucial for ensuring COBRA’s reliability and robustness in diverse and dynamic environments.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sim2real_head_trajectories-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sim2real_head_trajectories-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sim2real_head_trajectories-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/sim2real_head_trajectories.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="" height="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 7: Illustrates sim-to-real gap observed in COBRA’s head link trajectory while performing sidewinding gaits at frequencies of 0.35 Hz, 0.5 Hz, and 0.65 Hz respectively </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sim2real_joint_angles-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sim2real_joint_angles-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sim2real_joint_angles-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/sim2real_joint_angles.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="" height="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 8: Illustrates sim-to-real gap observed in COBRA’s joint angles while performing sidewinding gaits at frequencies of 0.35 Hz, 0.5 Hz, and 0.65 Hz respectivel </div> <hr> </body></html>
