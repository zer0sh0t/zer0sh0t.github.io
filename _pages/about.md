I am an experienced researcher with a Master’s degree in Robotics from Northeastern University, Boston, and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Surat, India. My areas of expertise include deep learning, reinforcement learning, control systems engineering, computer vision, and mechatronic design. I have a proven track record of working with a wide range of robotic systems, including snake robots, quadrupeds, humanoids, drones, and wheeled robots.

Driven by a passion for advancing humanity's future, my aim is to develop systems that enhance human capabilities in areas such as space exploration, disaster response, manufacturing, and beyond. If you share these interests, I would love to connect and discuss potential collaborations. Let's explore the possibilities together!
